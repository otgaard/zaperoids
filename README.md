zaperoids
---------

A small 2-player network game demonstrating how to use:

* zap (https://github.com/otgaard/zap)
* zapAudio (https://github.com/otgaard/zapAudio)
* asio (https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio)

The game is intended as a small prototype for demonstrating
game development in zap based on the classic Asteroids.
